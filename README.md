# volsurface_Sinkhorn
The test notebook is wip , gradient and hessian for the minimization for V need to be added, also want to test minimizing for one V_k at a time ,
and see if we can iterate to produce P_1 once we have a more speedy and stable minimisation for V
(also need to check again if minimising h is stable when iterating, the function blows up quite quickly away from the minimum so can only get convergence when choosing rly 
tight minimisation interval)
(SPX data file too large to upload on github, so you guys need to download it locally from blackboard)
